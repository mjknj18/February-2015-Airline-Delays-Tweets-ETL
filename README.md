# February-2015-Airline-Delays-Tweets-ETL

The purpose of this project was to perform an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process on Feruary 2015 airline flight performance and customer tweets, based on datasets obtained from Kaggle. The SQLAlchemy and Pandas modules in Python were used to import, clean, and process the data, while the former was used to output the transformed data into an SQL database.

## Questions

1. What extraction methods need to be used to import and clean the data from each dataset?
2. What transformation methods need to be used to process and manipulate the imported data?
3. What type of database does the transformed data need to be loaded into and what relationships need to be established?

## Datasets

1. https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays
